100 Numpy exercices
===================

The goal is both to offer a quick reference for new and old users and to
provide also a set of exercices for those who teach.

If you remember having asked or answered a (short) problem, you can send a pull
request. The format is:


#. Find indices of non-zero elements from [1,2,0,0,4,0]

   .. code:: python

      # Author: Somebody

      print np.nonzero([1,2,0,0,4,0])


If you can provide the assumed level of the answer, that would be even better.

Here is what the page looks like so far:

(The level names came from an old-game: Dungeon Master)
